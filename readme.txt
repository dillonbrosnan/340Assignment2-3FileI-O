ass 2-3: reads file that is hardcoded into program, from 6000th number in
text file, and stores all following numbers in a vector. cursor is reset to 
just after 6000th number, and begins to insert numbers 7777-7781, and finally
inserts numbers previously stored in vectors, back into file, ultimately 
inserting numbers 7777-7781 inbetween the 6000th and 6001st numbers in 
text file.
